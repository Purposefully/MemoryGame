## Functionality
Open loading the page, pairs of images have been randomly assigned to the gameboard and "covered" with question mark images.  The user clicks on a square to reveal the hidden image.  Once two squares have been selected, the game freezes for a couple seconds so the user can see both images.  If the images match, they are replaced with a success image.  If they do not match, they are covered with the question mark image again.

Once all images have been correctly paired, the center squares display a success message.  The user may click a button to continue to the final page which displays a birthday wish.

___

## Design
Placement of images is randomized so the game is new every time it played.

Selected images are displayed for a couple seconds during which no further clicks are registered.
